# Python File Browser
This is a *project* about a Python *file browser*. This is not a GUI-based file; I want to cover that in a future update.

## To-do list
Change out distro.linux_distribution() with distro.version, since distro.linux_distribution() is getting deprecated

## What Python version to use
Use Python version 3.x. Please do not use 2.x for this code.

## How to use this thing
Once you launch the file, you can see *the instructions in the terminal*.

## What can you do at this time
You can delete, go back, create folders and files, edit files, and view the current OS version and name.

## What to download
You need to *download*: distro, colorama.

## Credits
Me (of course), 
replit.com for testing this code

## Can I use this code?
Yes, you can use this code every time. Make sure to credit me!
